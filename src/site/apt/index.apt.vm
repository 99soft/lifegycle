Welcome to Lyfegycle!

  People often complained the Google Guice lack of support of EJB3.0 <<<@PostConstruct>>> and <<<@PreDestroy>>>
  annotations to manage the injected objects lifecycle.

  This small library aims to add that support in a lightweight yet dynamic way, allowing users define the annotations
  type they want to use to mark methods to execute once the injection is performed and when shutting down the
  application.

Before starting

  Lyfegycle is available on the Maven Central repo, you just need to add the dependency below in your <<<pom.xml>>> file:

+--------------------------------------+
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
+--------------------------------------+

  This work is dedicated to our city, L'Aquila, destroyed by a terrible
  earthquake the 6th April, 2009... That day more than 300 people were killed
  because buildings collapsed after a magnitudo 6.3 earthquake at 3:32 am.

  We'll never forget that episode.
